# Welcome to FizzBuzz tutorial!
# FizzBuzz is an extremely popular python problem to solve
# In most Python tests u will see this problem

# Our goal is to create a list of numbers in range 1 - 100 and print them all with some specific rules
# If a number when divided by 3 gives us 0 remainder , we r gonna print Fizz
# If a number when divided by 5 gives us 0 remainder , we r gonna print Buzz
# If a number when divided both by 3 and 5 gives us 0 remainder , we r gonna print FizzBuzz
# Else we r gonna print NULL





# Create a list of numbers in range 1 -100
numbers = []
for x in range (1,101):
    numbers.append(x)

# Do all the checkings ( use MOD % )
for num in numbers:
    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif num % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif num % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print("NULL")
